# Intro

This repo contains scripts that install firefox into `~/.local/share/firefox` with .desktop file intergration and a symlinked executable in `~/.local/bin` This is an alternative to the Flatpak or distro package. It is not sandboxed and it is not mixed with system files. These scripts don't even require root privleges.
